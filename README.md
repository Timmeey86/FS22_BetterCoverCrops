## A note on Terra Life Plus

### Is Conservation Agriculture compatible with Terra Life Plus?

No, it currently is not. If you load a Terra Life Plus map with CA in the mod folder, CA will automatically become deactivated.

### Will Conservation Agriculture be made compatible with Terra Life Plus?

As of now, I don't know. I will need some time to explore the features of Terra Life Plus so I can see wether or not there is even any point in having CA in addition to TLP.

### Will Conservation Agriculture come to FS25?

Most likely not. I will however integrate some of its features towards Terra Life Plus for FS25.

## Mod description

Make cover crops useful again!

This mod for Farming Simulator 22 strives to allow the player to respect the three [Conservation Agriculture principles](https://www.fao.org/conservation-agriculture/en/) (you can click on each principle to read about it) while at the same time getting a benefit in doing so. The general idea is to never leave your fields barren, but seed oilseed radish, grass or even grain or root crops directly after harvesting your cash crop and mulch them in the spring instead of harvesting them in order to get a mulching and fertilizing boost for your new cash crop.

### Feature Overview

Roller crimping cover crops and direct seeding straight into them:
